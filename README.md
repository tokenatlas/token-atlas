# token-atlas

This document aims to provide a comprehensive list of large open-source text datasets which can be used for pretraining LLMs. Large in this context means >100 GB of text. This can (ideally) be a useful resource for researchers who want to quickly get an overview of open-source efforts. This is especially relevant as there are multiple public projects that sometimes overlap. The document is currently not very comprehensive, so any help in listing datasets is appreciated.
